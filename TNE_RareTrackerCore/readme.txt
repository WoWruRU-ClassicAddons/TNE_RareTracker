They are scattered around in the stereotypical masses of mobs Azeroth. They usually drop something nice, and might even look cool or have a funny name. They? They are the rare spawns.

Whereever you venture, RareTracker will present you with a list of all the "silver elites" mobs that are known to be nearby. RareTracker will record the position, level, and race of all rare spawns when you find them. It will also add any rare mobs you manage to find if they are not in the database already.

Usage:
Each interface displays two numbers; the first is the number of known mobs in the zone, and second (in parenthesis) is the number of mobs in or near the subzone you're currently in. This is your general guide to the zone.

You can move the mouse cursor over the RareTracker frame to see a tooltip with more detailed information. Each mob will be listed with race and level, and if it's elite you'll see that too. You will also see coordinates for where you last saw each mob, or 0,0 if you havn't seen it before.

There are two ways to find rare mobs. The first is to tab through or mouse over mobs you come across. RareTracker will notify you with a screen messag if you find a rare mob this way; and can also target the mob to make sure you don't miss it. The other way is through 'scanning'. Right-click the RareTracker frame and choose 'Scan' from the menu (or simply click the frame), and it will automatically find any known rare mob nearby (note: you will NOT be able to discover new rares this way).

About autotargeting:
RareTracker can act in two ways when you find a rare mob:
 * When autotargeting is disabled, you will only recieve a screen alert about the rares RareTracker detect. This is the least intrusive way to use RareTracker.
 * When autotargeting is enabled, RareTracker will not only notify you with a screen alert; it will also target the detected mob. I advise you to be careful in combat when this mode is on; RareTracker has a limit to only detect and target each rare once every 10 minutes, but it's still a possible cause of accidents. Keep in mind that scanning always targets rare mobs (if any is nearby) in this mode.

About installation:
RareTracker is based on one core addon with all related and necessary functions. It works under the hood, and you need an interface to interact with it. Which interface to use depends on what other addons you have. I have provided a standard interface for anyone to use, and there are plugins for some popular addons (like Titan Panel).

Installation:
You will find the following folders when you are done extracting RareTracker:
 - RareTrackerCore: The core addon (required)
 - RareTrackerMap: An interface for your worldmap (optional)
 - RareTrackerStandard: A standalone interface (optional)
 - RareTrackerTitan: A plugin to TitanPanel (optional)
 - RareTrackerBossPanel: A plugin to BossPanel (optional)
Move the core and the interfaces you want to your Addons folder, just like you install other addons. You can safely delete the interfaces you don't want to use.

Other interfaces (I'm not involved in the creation of these):
 - StatusWindow RareTracker: Can be found at http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=2174

Let me know if you have or know about any other interfaces and would like them listed here.

Dependencies:
 - RareTrackerMap: Currently supports MapNotes (or MetaMap), CT_MapMod.
